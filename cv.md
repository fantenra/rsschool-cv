## A few words about me
Iâ€™m a junior web developer. At the moment I work in a local web-studio. Our projects rather small and standard solutions. I realized that I need to grow because I want to be involved in interesting projects, which can make the IT industry and people's lives better. So I joined the Rolling Scopes School and I am now on my way up to the front-end developer. IT and especially web development industry growing very fast. It requires many personal skills to keep up. I consider myself responsible and patient.

    for (var i = 0; i < textContentAll.length; i++) {
